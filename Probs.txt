PROBS I FACED:- 
1. Automatic reading when any files updated proablem i faced was that whole elt process would trigger for all input files resulting in duplicate data. 
2. 


EXCEPTIONS IN PROJ:-
1. If same db used for another job run then its not rewritten but data is just added ( so if same job is called twice then 
data is repeated as initial data is written wo checking for same dat ain db or no). If only ran once the job then same data 
is not repeated as CI makes sure that current job call no duplicates r entered.
