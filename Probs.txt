PROBS I FACED:- 
1. Automatic reading when any files updated proablem i faced was that whole elt process would trigger for all input files resulting in duplicate data. 
2. Css was not loading so tried manual try and error on each part then had to create another div for whole login box to add the effects.
3. Error: The backend expected a JWT with a valid identity object, but the frontend token lacked a proper "sub" or "identity" string, causing the error: "Subject must be a string".
   Solution: We fixed it by ensuring the JWT tokenâ€™s identity is a string (like the username) instead of a dictionary, i.e., used identity=username instead of {"username": ..., "role": ...} when calling create_access_token().
4. The yaml was read from file input only when trigger job sent as worked on it first. But just load to view data
   without running elt job also yaml should be read and data loaded in frontend. 
   Sol:- Sent the fileinput from admin dashboard to view data function button click. So yaml file sent on api call 
   POST data-view. 
5. While implementing sftp the code was showing error as extracted data to csv the csv was empty. But the upload 
   of file from docker to sftp server was correct. So ran only extract file to see what is error. The yaml file 
   was read but no output so realised that yaml structure for sftp is different. so changed that using ai and code worked !
   


EXCEPTIONS IN PROJ:-
1. If same db used for another job run then its not rewritten but data is just added ( so if same job is called twice then 
data is repeated as initial data is written wo checking for same dat ain db or no). If only ran once the job then same data 
is not repeated as CI makes sure that current job call no duplicates r entered. 
2.Schedule time is within when the laptop is on only.
