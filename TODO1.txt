INCLUDE AUTHENTICATION
    log in with username + password
    Server checks it and gives you a JWT
    You store the JWT in browser (usually in localStorage)
    Every request you send includes that JWT in the header:
    Authorization: Bearer <your-token>
    The server checks the token, and if it's valid, youâ€™re allowed in
