---pytest 
Pytest fixtures are functions that can be used to manage our apps states and dependencies. Most importantly, 
they can provide data for testing and a wide range of value types when explicitly called by our testing software. 
You can use the mock data that fixtures create across multiple tests

Smoke testing, in the context of software development, refers to a type of preliminary software testing 
that verifies the core functionalities of a new software build. It's a quick, high-level check to ensure 
that the basic features work as expected before more in-depth testing begins. 
Think of it as a "sanity check" to confirm the build is stable enough for further testing

--Extra 
SHA-256 produces a fixed-size, 256-bit (32-byte) output, regardless of the input data's size. 
This output, also known as a hash, is a unique fingerprint of the input.
